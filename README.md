GoPanel Pipe (proof of concept)
===============================

This is a very simple Go program to pipe system information to the terminal. Of course this can be done very easily with bash scripts. I thought it would be a good challenge of concurency within the go language. Later on I will extend this so it is completely modular and can be ran on multiple systems. IE: Linux distros, Mac,

This program was designed for arch linux and to work with the Bar ain't recursive package. 

TODO
====

Make it modular.

Split it up between running application and library.

Make it where it can be configured from a file or commandline options.

Possibly make it have a way to display on a xorg server
